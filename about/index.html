        <p>Hey there! This is me, Hiro Progatonist. I'm a world traveler.
        As I child, I grew up in 10 countries all around the world:</p>
        <div class="trips">Zimbabwe</div>
        <div class="trips">Estonia</div>
        <div class="trips">Uruguay</div>
        <div class="trips">Panama</div>
        <div class="trips">Cayman Islands</div>
        <div class="trips">Bermuda</div>
        <div class="trips">India</div>
        <div class="trips">Mongolia</div>
        <div class="trips">New Zealand</div>
        <div class="trips">The Netherlands</div>
        <br>
        <p>It so happens that my dad worked for the CIA  as a cover agent (now retired) in countries during civil unrest.
        For some reason we were deployed with him, as he usually held regular jobs to blend into society. For example,
        when we lived in Panama during the early 90s, my dad was an "senior partner" for a law firm opening a practice in Panama City.</p>
        <p>But this is about me, not him. I recently took a sabbatical after selling my startup to a company in the Bay Area.
        I'm exploring the world and learning from different cultures, religions and philosophies in an effort to expand
        my network and horizons. I eventually plan to settle down and work again, or whatever I decide to do professionally.</p>
        <p>This life of mine now is quite good, but at the same time it's sort of a bad omen in my social circles. I recently
        attended a party with other entrepreneurs and I was the only one not working on AI, big data, machine learning and all those
        buzzwords. Silicon Valley can be very judgmental, if you know what I mean. But I don't care, I've got "financial freedom" and
        couldn't care less with keeping up with the Joneses.</p>
        <p>Anyway, this isn't about me either. This is about my travels around the world during my sabbatical. I hope you like the pictures I take
        and the stuff I post. I've learned so much stuff already with my short visit to Cambodia. Anyways, I'll keep you posted. Peace out!</p>
