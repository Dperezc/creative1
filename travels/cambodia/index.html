        <h1>CAMBODIA</h1>
        <p>Also known as Kampuchea, officially the Kingdom of Cambodia, this is a country
        in South East Asia with a population of over 15 million people. Buddhism
        is the main religion in the country (with around 95% of adherents from the total population).</p>
        <p>I decided to visit Cambodia out of an interest for Buddhism. A few months
        ago I was in a bar in Palo Alto and a random girl started talking to me about
        world religions and how divisions are a man-made thing. When I asked her if
       she followed any philosophy she said she had just converted to Buddhism two days before
       after reading some obscure books by German writer Hermann Hesse.</p>
       <p>Anyhow, as the girl spoke to me I got my phone out and googled "boodism" (autocorrect did the trick).
       I scanned quickly through the Wikipedia article and found out that Buddhism was widespread in South East Asia,
       mentioning Cambodia first among other countries. Having recently obtained some money after selling my startup, I thought "what the heck, let's visit this place."
       </p>
       <p>Right there and then, while the girl (Elizabeth, maybe? she wore a black turtleneck and spoke with a deep baritone voice) was
         giving me her spiel for her newfound spiritual awakening, I opened my United app and booked a 2-week visit to this haven for Buddhism.</p>
       <p>The trip was a quite the experience. My first day there my phone got stolen by a band of
       macaques in the street (the animals run all around the place, they're like street dogs in Latin America). That's the main reason, patient reader,
       why I don't have any pictures for my first trip (sorry!). I reported my stolen phone to the local authorities but they told me
       there's nothing they could do unless it was a human. Quite convenient.</p>
       <p>Regardless of this rough start, I decided to make the most out of my trip. I ended up buying a Huawei phone (regardless of Trump's government position, they're very cheap and useful).
       It did the work while I was there. I visited Phnom Penh for two days. I couldn't understand a word of what people told me, but Google Translated came to my rescue.</p>
       <p>I visited Angkor and its many temples. Angkor Wat is the most important one in the area. The funny thing is that it was originally a Hindu temple, but then
       a king in the 12th century transformed it into a Buddhist one.</p>
       <p>You may ask, didn't you take any pictures with your Huawei? Well, yes and no. I took A LOT of pictures, but I couldn't enter the US with said phone because our government is afraid of Huawei's technology.
       So, my more than 1000 pictures got deleted during my flight from Paris to California (had plenty of time). I handed my phone to American authorities when I landed in SFO and, well, with it my digital memories of this wonderful place.</p>
       <p>Thanks for reading. Till my next adventure!</p>
